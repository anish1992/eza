## About Our Project
Our mission is to Provide a novice user-friendly system, which would contain the necessary information, to help maintain the aquarium with little time and effort.

Our objectives in the automated aquarium were to monitor and maintain appropriate water condition, constant water temperature and provide automated lighting.

To accomplish this we used a Raspberry Pi to trigger shot dispensers in order to dispense chemicals based on regulations on a need basis. Also, the Raspberry Pi would test for condition irregularities so that they could be corrected. The Raspberry Pi would also turn on and off the lights based on System time. The length of time the lights would be on would be determined by the type of fish living in the aquarium. All the condition could also be manually set.
